These files are intended to serve as a starting-point to an assignment
of the course Object-oriented programming in Java. I recommend that
you test it to make sure that the Java system finds all gif-files and
everything else works.

Files:

 - Dummy.java  

   Implements something that either moves randomly or stays
   still. Appears as a question mark in the simulation.  This class is
   not intended to be a part of your solution!

 - Engine.java  

   Drives the simulation. There is usually no need to change this
   file.

 - Entity.java  

   An interface. Any entity in the simulation should implement
   this. (Some students change the interface to an abstract class.)

 - PastureGUI.java  

   The user interface. There is usually no need to change this file.

 - Pasture.java. The main class. You will probably need to add code
   for initialization and setting parameters.

For more details, see my notes.
